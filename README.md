# AI-Drone

## Proof of Concept - Banana Stalker

We set ourselves a defined and achievable goal in the initial phase of the project:

A drone with integrated object detection which autonomously follows an object of a predefined type (for example a banana). 

Key attributes of the drone:

- Long range / low to medium speed
- Able to lift atleast additional 50g

---

Hardware selection:

- Propellers: 3,5" span because we would like to achieve maximum thrust while staying below 250g drone weight
    - Question: What is the optimal propeller form and material for our use case?
        - Thinner propellers are better for fast flying drones, less air resistance and less thurst on lower number of revolutions
        - Thicker propellers have more area and therefore have more thrust on lower number revolutions
